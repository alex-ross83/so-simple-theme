I freaking love this song.

One of the many things I have learned coming to this country is finding out that sometimes the songs of my youth actually are still referenced by some in a meaningful way.

This takes us to the objective of this post

## Announcement
Pushing it hard here to post regularly, and maybe add a feature or two to this Jekyll engine to support multiple languages

In the meantime enjoy the song, it is really good.
